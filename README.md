clinical-ui-syntax
=========================

Package to provide semantic CSS classes to your app.  Based on Bootstrap3.  


====================
## Installation

First, install the clinical-ui-syntax package from the command line, like so:

````js
mrt add clinical-ui-syntax
````

Alternatively, if you'd like to bypass Atmosphere, and install directly from GitHub, you could update your application's smart.json file, like so:

````json
{
  "meteor": {
    "branch": "master"
  },
  "packages": {
    "mousetrap": {
      "git": "https://github.com/awatson1978/clinical-ui-syntax.git"
    }
  }
}
````
